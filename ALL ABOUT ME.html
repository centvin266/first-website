    <p id="p18">
      I am Vincent Vizcara Malagasi. You can call me vince, centvin or anything
      you want. I was born on March 30, 2008 in Caloocan city.I have alot of
      interest that makes me happy, for example I love playing online games as
      this really helps me to have fun time with others, I also find fun on
      doing or learning new things, i belive doing or learning new things can
      help me to unlock new skills, therefore become better not just in one
      field but also in other. I basically not introvert or extrovert in in the
      middle of that, which is good sometimes because it help me to balance
      things out, for example i love walking alone, eating alone, and doing
      something alone, yet you can aslo see me eating with someone, walking with
      friends and doing stupid things with others. I may not be handsokme or
      attractive, but of course i know how to make myself decent
